This library is available through the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software), so if you havent already, download it now. If you are using a different IDE and need to manually install the library, follow the instructions in the next section.

- Follow this sequence of menus: `Sketch -> Add Library -> Manage libraries...` and click. 
- Once the library manager window appears, type `PrintEx` into the search bar, or find it in the list.
- When found, click on the list entry and the install button will appear.
- Click install, and when complete, the process is finished.


## Manually installing **`PrintEx`**.

- Extract the contents to a desired location.
- In your project, simply include `src/PrintEx.h` in your projects.
